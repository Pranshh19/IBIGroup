What are Higher-Order Components (HOC) in React and how do they work?
Ans: 

So Higher order componet feature of react is somewhat similar to the layout feature of Nodejs
In Nodejs we create a file layout.ejs and then instakk a package manage ejs layout, what it does is it basically let you use the layout file in multiple ejs file

The same holds true for HOC, the difference here is, the componets are copied, 

Ex: If I have to create a button and use it everywhere

I will create a HOC of button

then wherever I need the use of button, I will simply Import button from ./Button 

and then use <Button> </Button> 
the file Button will include all the code that will be executed.
