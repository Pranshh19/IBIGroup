Cookies

Cookies are sent to the server with each request, and they have smaller storage limit. 
The main use of cookies is to store the data of user so that they don't have to log in at every page
when traversing the page. 

Ex: 
Use of cookies in shopping cart to remember the item that we've added. 


Session: 
session is again a kind of storage, one can think of it as when you log in, a session is created, 
that session time limit can be specifies in the server side, suppose if it's 1hr then after 1hr, the user will be automatically logged out. 

Ex: PWSkiils website, the session limit is 24hr


Local Storage: 
Local storage is again a mechanism to store the data, this storage is saved locally even if the browsed is closed. 
It can be used to store caching data. Generally data that is going to be reptetively used is cached for faster access.
