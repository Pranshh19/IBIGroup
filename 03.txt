What is Sharding in MongoDB, and how does it work?

To be very honest, I don't know what Sharding is before, 
but after researching the documentation this is my understanding from it:


So sharding can be thought of as distributed systems,
The goal of distributed system is to make the application scalable and make it free from single point of failure,

Same is true for sharding. 
Sharding in MongoDB is basically a way to partion the data and store across multiple servers. The data is each server is limited to certain range.
